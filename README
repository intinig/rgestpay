RGESTPAY
========

RGestPay is the ruby port of GestPayCryptHS, the Java class released by 
EasyNolo to help implement the GestPay payment gateway.

USAGE
=====

require 'gest_pay'

c = GestPay::CryptRequest.new(your_shop_login)
t = GestPay::TransactionData.new(
      :amount => 1.34  # In Euro
      :currency => 242 # It means Euro, check the GestPay manual for other codes
      :shop_transaction_id => "something"
    )
    
# Get the first encryption
t = c.encrypt(t)
# Check for errors
unless t.[:error_code].nil?
  raise "ERROR"
end
# Now you have the encrypted data
puts t[:encrypted_str] # => "VERY LONG STRING"

# After you redirect the user to the payment server using t[:encrypted_string] as the "b"
# parameter, you get back an encrypted string from the server
t = c.decrypt("string I got from the server")
puts t[:transaction_result] # => "OK"
